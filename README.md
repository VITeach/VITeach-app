## 🔶 Overview 📔

<div align="justify">
  
VITeach is a non-profit organization founded and run by a group of motivated students from Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, who are driven by a passion for change. With an assortment of 161 active members, the club has been able to directly impact the lives of over 4,83,400 students along the years.

## 🔶 Vision and Mission 🎯

<div align="justify">

**Mission:** VITeach aims not only to teach the kids but also to provide them with an environment where they can grow unhindered just like how a seed transforms into a young sapling with light, water, love, and care. Taking that extra effort is what VITeach is all about.

Since its inception in the year 2013, VITeach has evolved from a club that helped students with basic and conversational English in a single government school to a club that has completed several projects with a focus on interactive learning. Now, it is emerging further to provide quality education through online resources.

<div align="justify">
  
**Vision:** VITeach seeks equal and quality education for all, especially for those who are denied equity in resources and opportunities. The organization has members from all branches of engineering and other majors like Law, MBA, etc. who have all come together to work for a common goal - the betterment of those less fortunate than themselves.

The club’s vision of bestowing underprivileged students an opportunity to get the resources they deserve and have a solid chance at contributing to society has ensured that VITeach has remained strong for 8 years and counting.
