**VITeach Learning App: Transforming Education Through Technology** :sparkles:


## Overview

VITeach is a student-run social outreach club at VIT Chennai, committed towards educating and imparting values to underprivileged children. With the collaboration of students from all the batches and branches, the two major projects - Adi Dravida Nadunilai Palli at Melakottaiyur and Government High School at Kandigai, have been significantly brightening the lives of the children there.
## Vision and Mission

:dart: **Mission:** VITeach aims not only to teach the kids, but to also provide them with an environment where they can grow unhindered just like how a seed transforms into a young sampling when provided with light, water, love and care. Taking that extra effort is what VITeach is all about.

Since its inception in the year 2013, VITeach has evolved from a club that helped students with basic and conversational English in a single government school, to a club that has completed several projects with a focus on interactive learning. Now, it is emerging further with the aim of providing quality education through online resources.


**Vision:** VITeach seeks equal and quality education for all, especially for those who are denied equity in resources and opportunities. The organization has members from all branches of engineering and other majors like Law, MBA etc. who have all come together to work for a common goal - the betterment of those less fortunate than themselves.

The clubâ€™s vision of bestowing upon the under-privileged students an opportunity to get the resources they deserve and have a solid chance at contributing to society, is what has ensured that VITeach has remained strong, 8 years and counting.
